### AWS Credentials and CLI
I already use the AWS CLI and credentials for deploying infrastructure in terraform from my Windows and Linux computers. I followed the bootcamp videos to set up AWS CLI in gitpod for use in the project.


### Budget and billing notifications set up
I already have a budget set up on the account I'm using for the bootcamp some months back for use on person experimental projects. I attached proof of the running budget below.

I also followed the bootcanp videos to learn how to set up budget and billing alarms + notifications using the CLI, I modified the json files but did not apply them to have duplicating the budgets.
